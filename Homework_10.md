## Part 1: Proving $S_3$ and $C_{3h}$ are the same group

Group structure of $C_{3h}$

The point group $C_{3h}$ consists of symmetry operations that leave a system with a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane invariant. It is generated by:

- $C_3$: Rotation by $120^\circ$ about the principal axis (taken as the $z$-axis)
- $\sigma_h$: Reflection through a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis

The group elements are:

$$
C_{3h} = \{E, C_3, C_3^2, \sigma_h, C_3\sigma_h, C_3^2\sigma_h\}
$$

where $C_3^3 = E$, $\sigma_h^2 = E$, and $ C_3 $ commutes with $\sigma_h$ (since the rotation axis is perpendicular to the mirror plane). The group has order 6.

Group structure of $S_3$

In point group notation, $S_3$ is generated by the improper rotation $S_3^1 = C_3\sigma_h$, which is a rotation by $120^\circ$ followed by reflection. Computing powers:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(S_3^1)^1 &= C_3\sigma_h \\
(S_3^1)^2 &= C_3^2 \\
(S_3^1)^3 &= \sigma_h \\
(S_3^1)^4 &= C_3 \\
(S_3^1)^5 &= C_3^2\sigma_h \\
(S_3^1)^6 &= E
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus:

$$
S_3 = \{E, S_3^1, S_3^2, S_3^3, S_3^4, S_3^5\}
$$


Define a mapping $\phi: C_{3h} \rightarrow S_3$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\phi(E) &= E \\
\phi(C_3) &= S_3^4 \\
\phi(C_3^2) &= S_3^2 \\
\phi(\sigma_h) &= S_3^3 \\
\phi(C_3\sigma_h) &= S_3^1 \\
\phi(C_3^2\sigma_h) &= S_3^5
\end{aligned}
$$

## Part 2: Proving $C_{3v}$ and $D_3$ are the same group

Group structure of $C_{3v}$

The point group $C_{3v}$ consists of symmetry operations for systems with a threefold rotation axis and vertical mirror planes containing that axis. It is generated by:

- $C_3$: Rotation by $120^\circ$ about the $z$-axis
- $\sigma_v$: Reflection through a vertical plane containing the rotation axis

There are three distinct vertical mirror planes (separated by $60^\circ$). The group elements are:

$$
C_{3v} = \{E, C_3, C_3^2, \sigma_v, \sigma_v', \sigma_v''\}
$$

where $\sigma_v, \sigma_v', \sigma_v''$ are the three vertical reflections. The group has order 6 and is non-abelian.

Group structure of $D_3$

The point group $D_3$ consists of symmetry operations for systems with a threefold rotation axis and three twofold rotation axes perpendicular to it. It is generated by:

- $C_3$: Rotation by $120^\circ$ about the principal axis
- $C_2$: Rotation by $180^\circ$ about an axis perpendicular to the principal axis

There are three distinct $C_2$ axes (separated by $60^\circ$). The group elements are:

$$
D_3 = \{E, C_3, C_3^2, C_2, C_2', C_2''\}
$$

where $C_2, C_2', C_2''$ are rotations about the three perpendicular axes. The group has order 6 and is non-abelian.



Both $C_{3v}$ and $D_3$ are isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$ (permutations of three objects). An explicit isomorphism $\psi: C_{3v} \rightarrow D_3$ can be defined by:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\psi(E) &= E \\
\psi(C_3) &= C_3 \\
\psi(C_3^2) &= C_3^2 \\
\psi(\sigma_v) &= C_2 \\
\psi(\sigma_v C_3) &= C_2 C_3 \\
\psi(\sigma_v C_3^2) &= C_2 C_3^2
\end{aligned}
$$

where we identify $\sigma_v', \sigma_v''$ with $\sigma_v C_3$ and $\sigma_v C_3^2$ respectively, and similarly for $C_2', C_2''$.

**Verification**: The key relation in $ C_{3v} $ is $\sigma_v C_3 \sigma_v = C_3^2$. In $D_3$, the corresponding relation is $C_2 C_3 C_2 = C_3^2$. Under $\psi$, we have $\psi(\sigma_v) = C_2$ and $\psi(C_3) = C_3$, so:

$$
\psi(\sigma_v C_3 \sigma_v) = C_2 C_3 C_2 = C_3^2 = \psi(C_3^2)
$$

Thus the group structure is preserved. Therefore, $C_{3v} \cong D_3$.

This mapping is bijective. To verify it preserves the group operation, note that both groups are cyclic of order 6 generated by $C_3\sigma_h$ in $C_{3h}$ and $S_3^1$ in $S_3$. Since $\phi(C_3\sigma_h) = S_3^1$, and both generators have order 6, the multiplication tables are identical. Therefore, $C_{3h} \cong S_3$.
