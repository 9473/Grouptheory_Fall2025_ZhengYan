1. For a finite group with three elements e, a, and b, the multiplication table can be represented as:

$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}  & e & a & b \\ \hline e & e & a & b \\ a & a & e & c \\ b & b & c & e \\ \end{array}
$$

In this table, ee is the identity element, aa and bb are the other two elements of the group, and cc represents the result of combining aa and bb (which should follow the group's operation). You may need to substitute cc with specific elements based on the group's structure.

2. For the symmetric group $S_3$, the multiplication table is as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}  & e & a & b & c & d & f \\ \hline e & e & a & b & c & d & f \\ a & a & e & d & f & b & c \\ b & b & f & e & d & c & a \\ c & c & d & f & e & a & b \\ d & d & c & a & b & e & f \\ f & f & b & c & a & d & e \\ \end{array}
$$

Where $e$ is the identity element, $a, b, c, d$, and $f$ represent the permutations of the three objects in $S_3$.
